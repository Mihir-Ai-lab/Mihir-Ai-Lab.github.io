[About](/about.md){: style="font-size: 20px;"} |

With over a decade of experience navigating the diverse realms of Marketing, Business Management, Manufacturing, and Logistics, I bring a wealth of expertise to the table. Recently certified in Data Science and FinTech, my passion revolves around harnessing the full potential of Machine Learning.

I immerse myself in cutting-edge tools such as Python, PowerBI, MySQL, and Jupyter Notebooks, extracting profound insights from intricate datasets. Challenges are not obstacles but catalysts that fuel my drive. I excel in identifying architectural weak points, implementing effective solutions, and find joy in automation, streamlining processes, and optimizing efficiency.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I actively contribute to community building. Join me on [The Data Science Guy Live Hub](https://thedatascienceguy.live/hub/login) for collaborative coding adventures. Additionally, I am passionately working on a Concept, a Data Asset Management & Distributed Computing Platform ([Ostrich Solutions](https://github.com/Mihir-Ai-lab/Ostrich_solutions/blob/05737357fffcc6d3137f86e063ebe913aa73573f/README.md)). I'm eager to collaborate with freelancers who share the vision. I enjoy leading by example, fostering discussions, and encouraging collaborative efforts. Let's connect and explore opportunities for impactful collaboration and success.
