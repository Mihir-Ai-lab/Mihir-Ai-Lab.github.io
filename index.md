[About](/about.md){: style="font-size: 20px;"} |

Embarking on a journey through Marketing, Business Management, Manufacturing, and Logistics for over a decade, I've cultivated expertise across diverse domains. Newly certified in Data Science and FinTech, my passion lies in unlocking the full potential of Machine Learning.

Immersing myself in cutting-edge tools—Python, PowerBI, MySQL, and Jupyter Notebooks—I draw profound insights from intricate datasets. Challenges aren't hurdles but sparks that fuel my drive. I excel in pinpointing architectural weak points, crafting effective solutions, and finding joy in automation, streamlined processes, and optimized efficiency.

Beyond professional pursuits, I actively foster community on [The Data Science Guy Live Hub](https://thedatascienceguy.live/hub/login). Simultaneously, I'm shaping a visionary concept—[Ostrich Solutions](https://github.com/Mihir-Ai-lab/Ostrich_solutions/blob/05737357fffcc6d3137f86e063ebe913aa73573f/README.md), a Data Asset Management & Distributed Computing Platform. I'm eager to collaborate with freelancers who share the vision. Let's explore the journey together!
